### Purpose

To analyze how previous fundraising campaigns fared in relation to launch date and goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May, June and July saw the most fundraising campaigns for Theatre launched. November, December and January were 3 of the 4 lowest months regarding number of launches.

May, June and July also had the highest percentage of successful campaigns.The months with the lowest percentage of successful campaigns were October, December and January.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Plays with a fundraising goal between 1000 and 4999 was the most common with the second highest percentage of success. It also had the highest percentage of failures.

The highest success rate belonged to plays with a goal of under 1000. 

The difference between the two goals in failure percentage is 3.1%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The pivot table is filtered to show only results for Theatre; the chart based on goals shows the results for plays. I do not recall if there were other subcategories other than plays under Theatre.

The spelling differences between American English and British English can cause some confusion when writing formulas for a student from Canada.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Louise would increase her chances for a successful fundraising campaign by launching it during May, June or July. She should avoid launching the campaign in October, November, December and January.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Louise should set her fundraising goal between 1000 and 4999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Factors that may drive the success (or expectations) of fundraising campaigns (such as director, cast) are not revealed which may account for the different goals. 

We do not know why a given medium (television, film, theatre), was chosen for a given project and may have been incorrectly chosen.

We do know what the categories "staff_pick" and "spotlight" mean.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

If cast and director are revealed, we can assign points which correspond to how much $ they can draw. A bar graph would be a good way to summarize the subsequent goal and whether the campaign was a success/failure in securing that goal.
